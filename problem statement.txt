Problem Statement

Businesses often track sales targets at a category and monthly level, but transactional data is usually available at order and item levels. This mismatch makes it difficult to evaluate whether the business is meeting its sales goals.

The objective of this project is to analyze order-level sales data by integrating order, order-item, and sales target datasets to evaluate overall sales performance and measure target achievement across product categories and time periods.

Using Python, this project cleans and transforms raw transactional data into analysis-ready datasets, identifies sales trends and profitability patterns, and compares actual sales against predefined targets to highlight underperforming and overperforming categories.
