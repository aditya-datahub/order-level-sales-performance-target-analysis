Order-Level Sales Performance & Target Analysis

Problem Statement

Businesses often define sales targets at a monthly and category level, while actual transactional data is recorded at order and order-item levels. This difference in data granularity makes it challenging to accurately evaluate sales performance and measure whether business targets are being achieved.

The objective of this project is to bridge this gap by integrating order-level, order-item, and sales target datasets to analyze overall sales performance and assess target achievement across product categories and time periods.

Using Python, this project performs data cleaning, transformation, and integration to create analysis-ready datasets. It then evaluates key sales and profitability metrics, analyzes monthly and category-wise trends, and compares actual sales against predefined targets to identify underperforming and overperforming categories.
